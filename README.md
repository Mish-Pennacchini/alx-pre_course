My first readme
I completed this assigned project with tons of google searches, coffee runs and short naps, messy hair and a very messy mind.   
Had my first run with Vi editing, using the platform to edit and replace lines in a file: These are the shortcuts I worked with >>>

$ vi <filename> — Open or edit a file.
i — Switch to Insert mode.
Esc — Switch to Command mode.
:w — Save and continue editing.
:wq or ZZ — Save and quit/exit vi.
:q! — Quit vi and do not save changes.

I Created my first branch with 'git branch branch.name' and worked on pushing it to git with 'git push origin (branch name)' from my command line.
I feel confident about navigating my way around branches and files on the command line using basic commands like 

cd [to change to a directory]
pwd [Where am I in the maze?]
ls [for listing content of a directory or file]
touch [for creating files in directories]
echo [for creating lines in touch files]
cat [for viewing files containg lines]
mkdir [for making new directories]
rm -r [for deleting directories with content in them]

I understood repositories better after completing this and the Git platform makes much more sence after running through the assignment multiple times.
The phrases 'cloning repositories, pushing branches, pull requests, roots... are all more familiar now. 

Thank you to my Cohort_13 @ALX SE for all the motivation and believeing in #DOING_HARD_THINGS_!
This project is NOT something I am thrilled about sharing, but I hope I can look back on it someday and feel good about how much progress I have made #hopetomyfutureself =)
